# hindrance

A convenience library for working with a particularly inconvenient authentication mechanism (OAuth 2.0 JWT Bearer Credentials Flow).

Provided are two convenience functions for making authenticated reuqests using [clj-http](https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http):

```clojure
(ns your-project.core
   (:require [hindrance.core :refer [with-credentials]
             [clj.http :as client])

;; Provide your oauth credentials in the form of a map with the
;; following keys:
(def my-creds
  {:client-id "my-client-id"
   :shared-secret "some-long-shared-secret"
   :token-url "https://your-token-provider.com"})

;; Having done so, you can now use with-credentials to transparently make OAuth requests:
(with-credentials my-creds client/get "https://some.authenticated-service.com")
```

The above will first make a POST request to the identity provider and store the received token locally, then add it to the Authorization headers in your request (none of the other readers or any other items from the request map will be changed).  The stored token will be used for all following authenticated requests until it expires, at which time a new one will be retrieved.

If you prefer to load your configuration from the environment, there is an equivalent function `with-oauth-token` that assumes that the following details are present as environment variables (or any other place where [environ](https://github.com/weavejester/environ) can access them):

- `HINDRANCE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`: Your client_id, as assigned by your OAuth provider.
- `HINDRANCE_OAUTH_SHARED_SECRET`: The shared secret key assigned by your OAuth provider.
- `HINDRANCE_OAUTH_TOKEN_URL`: The URL to which you post your JWTs to receive an access token.

```clojure
(ns your-project.core
  (:require [hindrance.core :refer [with-oauth-token]]
            [clj-http.client :as client]))

;; This is equivalent to the example above, except the values for the identity provider request
;; will be read from environmental variables.
(with-oauth-token client/post "https://cool.service.com" {:form-params {:foo "bar"}})
```

In addition to the examples above, if you just want the token and don't care about the convenience functions (e.g., you aren't using clj-http):

```clojure
(ns your-project.core
  (:require [hindrance.core :refer [get-access-token]]))

(def my-credentials
  { ... })

(get-access-token my-credentials)
;; Will return your access token, as a string.
```

## Usage

In your project.clj: 

```
[thirtyspokes/hindrance "1.0.0"]
```

Or if your desires are *unconventional*:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>thirtyspokes</groupId>
  <artifactId>hindrance</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```
